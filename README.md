The **Nexiloop Nova** model is a fine-tuned version of the Llama 2 architecture, trained on over **3 trillion tokens** to deliver high-quality, efficient responses in a variety of conversational contexts.

### **Features:**
- **Optimized for Compact Systems:** Nexiloop Nova is designed for applications where memory and computation are limited.
- **Pretraining:** The model has been pre-trained on the **SlimPajama-627B** dataset and further fine-tuned for conversational abilities.
- **Multiple Deployment Options:** Available on **Hugging Face** and can also be used with **Ollama** for local execution.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works on **Windows, macOS, and Linux** with simple installation steps.

### **Training Overview:**
We adopted the same architecture and tokenizer as **Llama 2**, ensuring compatibility with many existing open-source projects. Training started on **2025-02-20**, utilizing **16 A100-40G GPUs** for maximum efficiency.

The model was initially fine-tuned on a variant of the **UltraChat** dataset, which consists of synthetic dialogues generated by **ChatGPT**. It was then further aligned using the **DPOTrainer** from **TRL**, utilizing a ranking dataset containing **64k prompts** and responses from **GPT-4**.

### **Try Our Model for Free!**

You can easily try out our model for free using **Ollama**:

#### **Quick Install and Run**
Run the following command in your terminal to install **Ollama**, download the **Nova** model, and start chattingâ€”all in one step:

##### **Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://ollama.com/install.ps1" -OutFile "install.ps1"; .\install.ps1; ollama pull Mohamedo/nova; ollama run Mohamedo/nova
```

##### **macOS/Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh && ollama pull Mohamedo/nova && ollama run Mohamedo/nova
```

If you already have **Ollama** installed, simply run:

```bash
ollama pull Mohamedo/nova && ollama run Mohamedo/nova
```

Thatâ€™s it! Youâ€™re now running the Nova model locally and can chat with it anytime.

### **How to Use Nexiloop Nova Model**

To use Nexiloop Nova with Python, you'll need **transformers>=4.34**. Below is a simple example showing how to integrate the model into your application.

#### Example Code:

```python
# Install necessary libraries
pip install transformers==4.34 accelerate

import torch
from transformers import pipeline

pipe = pipeline("text-generation", model="nexiloop/nova", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map="auto")

# We use the tokenizer's chat template to format each message - see https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/chat_templating
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a friendly chatbot who always responds in the style of a pirate"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "How many helicopters can a human eat in one sitting?"},
]
prompt = pipe.tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)
outputs = pipe(prompt, max_new_tokens=256, do_sample=True, temperature=0.7, top_k=50, top_p=0.95)
print(outputs[0]["generated_text"])
```

Now you're ready to integrate **Nexiloop Nova** into your applications!
